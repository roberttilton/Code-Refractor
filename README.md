# 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor

## What This Is
* An example website in which I fixed up various errors in the code present, and followed the rule of "leaving it more neat than I found it" in fixing many of those issues.

## What I Did
* I fixed the link from the header of the page to the content (specifically Search Engine Optimization). 
* I also tidied up the CSS, with many classes and id's repeated unnecessarily. The HTML appears fine to my eye, so I didn't really touch anything there.
* Left comments in the CSS explaining what I did where (usually just folding the classes together)
